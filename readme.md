Before running the final program, you need to make a testcase file, for that, you need to run testcase.py 
To run that, `python testcase.py` or `python3 testcase.py`
This will create file named 
- "TestCase.txt"

There are several files, the file to run is `main.cpp`. 
The file can be run using the command 
`g++ main.cpp rbtree.cpp compaction.cpp read.cpp -lm -pthread`
This will create a file `a.out`, and it can executed using the command `./a.out`
